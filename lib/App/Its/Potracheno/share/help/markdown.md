Markdown

## Use markdown for issue descriptions & comments.

##\#\# A headline

\* this becomes a bulleted list

* \*text between asterisks\* becomes *italic text*
* \*\*text between double asterisks\*\* becomes **bold text**
* \[link text\](http://www.example.com/link/uri) becomes a hyperlink.

More features to follow.

Use <*code*></*code*> tags around code samples.

Use <*quote*></*quote*> tags to quote someone.

Use <*plain*></*plain*> tags to add a paragraph of unprocessed text.

**NOTE** These tags cannot be nested (yet).

**NOTE** Tags can be diven in UPPERCASE or mixed case, but opening and
closing ones must match exactly due to bug in older Perls which
Potracheno has no work around as of yet.

## Preview mode

Please note that any form that offers preview will *not* allow to save
its content if input was modified.
Instead, a new preview page will be generated with "Preview" and "Save"
buttons shown again.
