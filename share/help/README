To make a /help/foobar url, one must:

* place a foobar.md file in this directory;
* add a *topic* to the first line;
* add a markdown-formatted body.

Everything but the first line will be processed by markdown;
first line is posted as the title and NOT handled by markdown.

Sorry for the inconvenience...
