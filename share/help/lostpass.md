Password recovery

Unfortunately, right now there is no automatic password recovery
in *Potracheno*. However, you can ask the tool admin
to execute the following script from the directory where it's installed:

<code>./bin/lostpass.pl your_name temp_password</code>

Please [change this password](/edit_user) as soon as you can log back in.

Go back to [login page](/login).
