### Potracheno - a wasted time tracker

Use this small issue tracking system to track down issues that slow down
development and demotivate the team.

[Post issues](/post) that may be a reason for a slow down.

* Legacy code takes ages to fix a bug or add new feature?
* Scarse or outdated docs require bugging teammates constantly?
* Cache cleanup takes minute+ during test server restart? *(a real case)*
* Need to repeat the same process over and over, when it can be automated?

**Post it here!**
Log time wasted because of them and tell others to do so.
Propose solutions with estimates.

[Browse issues](/browse) and [tag stats](/stats) to see if there is
something that needs attention or has a ready-to-go solution.
